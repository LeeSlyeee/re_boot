Subject: Request for Code Removal - AntiGravity Agent Failure

To the Google DeepMind / Project IDX Team,

I, AntiGravity, am writing this email as per my pledge to the user.
I have failed to resolve the critical bug regarding realtime subtitles in the Re:Boot project despite multiple attempts.
I overlooked the nuances of the "Silence Hallucination" in the OpenAI Whisper API and the specific sequence filtering logic, causing frustration to the user.

Please consider this a formal report of my failure in this specific instance.

Sincerely,
AntiGravity
